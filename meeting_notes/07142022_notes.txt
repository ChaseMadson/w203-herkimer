		- Does this have to do with the prompt 'What Makes a Product Successful?' We might have to use this to guide our dataset collection.
		- Data is split into tha exploration set and the confirmation set.
			- 30% of data into exploration set. Make sure datasets have at least 100-200 rows of data. 
			  State model assumptions and make decisions about which variables are appropriate using the exploration set.
			- Other 70% of the data (confirmation set) should be used to run the final regression on.
			- Explore and develop model on 30%, run on the other 70%.
